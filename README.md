## 👋 Hello everyone!

I'm just starting out and this is my first real undertaking so I'm gonna try my best not to mess up too much. I don't really expect anyone to be here in the discussion area this early in my progress, but I decided that I'd set one up anyone just for the heck of it.

## 📝 What I'm working on at the moment:

- 📄 Getting starter templates set up for VS Code and Codespaces.
- 🖥️ Learning the ropes of setting up repos.
- ✏️ I want to start my code journey on:
	- Javascript
	- CSS
	- Markdown

## Obsidian & a 2nd Brain
I've also been working with Obsidian a lot here lately so I'm trying to do my best to learn up on template skills for that as well as scripting some... So I feel like I have my hands a little full at the moment.
